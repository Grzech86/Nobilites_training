//Zadanie 18: Call Center: Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager,
//        and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the
//        respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not
//        free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and
//        data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to
//        the first available employee.
